## Ideas

I thought of something like `Reigns: Her majesty`.

You'll be a monster living in a cave near a village and each night you'll have to decide for each villager what you want to do with them:

- Rob them
- Kill them
- Leave them 

- [x] Nights counter
- [ ] Villagers counter

This won't be really enjoyable to play but this will be the MVP.

If I have enough time, I want to implement the following :

- [x] Villagers getting hint on where you live as you rob / kill too many villager in a row
	- [x] If they get enough hint, they'll come and kill you during the day
	- [x] Indicator for villager's anger ?
- [ ] Something to do with the money robbed
	- [ ] Hire someone to reduce the villager's anger
	- [ ] Hire someone to kill a villager for you (so villagers don't get hint for you when a villager dies)

## To-do

- [x] Change the way cards are displayed to be relative to the canvas size
	- For now, the x and y values are hardcoded
- [x] Add a Death screen that sums up all the money you gained / how many villagers you killed and how many nights you survived before getting killed by the villagers
	- [x] Killed villagers count
	- [x] "you have been killed by angry villagers" text
