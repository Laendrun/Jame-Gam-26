## Ideas

I thought of something like `Reigns: Her majesty`.

You'll be a monster living in a cave near a village and each night you'll have to decide for each villager what you want to do with them:

- Rob them
- Kill them
- Leave them 

- [x] Nights counter
- [x] Villagers counter

This won't be really enjoyable to play but this will be the MVP.

If I have enough time, I want to implement the following :

- [x] Villagers getting hint on where you live as you rob / kill too many villager in a row
	- [x] If they get enough hint, they'll come and kill you during the day
	- [x] Indicator for villager's anger ?
- [ ] Something to do with the money robbed
	- [x] Hire someone to reduce the villager's anger
	- [x] Hire someone to kill a villager for you (so villagers don't get hint for you when a villager dies)

## To-do

- [x] Change the way cards are displayed to be relative to the canvas size
	- For now, the x and y values are hardcoded
- [x] Add a Death screen that sums up all the money you gained / how many villagers you killed and how many nights you survived before getting killed by the villagers
	- [x] Killed villagers count
	- [x] "you have been killed by angry villagers" text
- [Â ] Animate the cards when choosing left / right / up instead of just switching to the new one
- [ ] Display inventory properly when in invetory state
- [ ] Display a kind of hotbar in playing state to display how much of each items you have
- [ ] Display texts in a more readable way and all
- [ ] Chance to get a random item instead of money when robbing a villager
- [ ] Some villagers are richer so you can get more money by robbing them but the anger level goes up quicker
