## Ideas

I thought of something like `Reigns: Her majesty`.

You'll be a monster living in a cave near a village and each night you'll have to decide for each villager what you want to do with them:

- Rob them
- Kill them
- Leave them 

- [ ] Nights counter
- [ ] Villagers counter

This won't be really enjoyable to play but this will be the MVP.

If I have enough time, I want to implement the following :

- [ ] Villagers getting hint on where you live as you rob / kill too many villager in a row
	- [ ] If they get enough hint, they'll come and kill you during the day
	- [ ] Indicator for villager "hint" ?
- [ ] Something to do with the money robbed
	- [ ] Hire someone to reduce the "hint" of the villagers
	- [ ] Hire someone to kill a villager for you (so villagers don't get hint for you when a villager dies)
